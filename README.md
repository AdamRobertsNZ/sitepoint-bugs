# SitePoint Bugs

A repository for bug reports and general reader feedback

## What are bugs

Bugs can be any of these:

- misinformation in posts
- badly categorized articles (if you see a post in the wrong category)
- outdated posts that desperately need a revamp
- missing syntax highlights in posts
- missing series parts (series ends abruptly after part 1 - common in super-old posts)
- layout bugs (CSS, mobile layout problems, etc)

Feel free to also report:

- sites copying our work outright
- people badmouthing us
- posts about SitePoint that are obviously wrong and/or spreading misconceptions
- anything else *negative* that you can think of
- 
## How to report

Just open a new issue and add as much detail as possible.

Thanks!
